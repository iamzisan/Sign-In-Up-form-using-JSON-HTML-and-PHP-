		<h3>Short Description:</h3>
		

		<p>These projects designed to make us think about what are we learning in a slightly different way and to gain experience. <br>We choose hospital management system to prevent all the manual problems and make our life easier. Hospital is the essential part of our lives. <br>It is necessary for the hospitals to keep track of its day-to-day activities and records. <br>But keeping track of all the activities are very time consuming and highly unreliable. <br>The main aim of our project is to provide a paper-less hospital up to 90%. It also aims at providing low cost, secure and reliable automation of existing system.</p>
